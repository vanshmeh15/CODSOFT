Description: Welcome to the Codsoft Internship Data Science Repository! Here, you'll find a showcase of my journey and achievements during the internship, featuring hands-on projects that delve into various facets of data science. Dive into the realm of predictive analytics and classification with the following projects:

Sales Price Prediction using Python:

Explore the power of predictive modeling as I leverage Python to forecast sales prices. Uncover the intricacies of the dataset and witness how advanced algorithms can accurately predict future sales figures.


Titanic Survival Prediction:

To predict survival on the Titanic, you can use machine learning models on a dataset that includes information about passengers, such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare. Here's a basic example using Python and the scikit-learn library to build a simple logistic regression model.


Credit Card Fraud Detection:

Delve into the critical realm of fraud detection in financial transactions. This project showcases my expertise in developing a robust model for identifying and preventing credit card fraud using cutting-edge techniques in data science.


Feel free to explore the code, datasets, and documentation provided in each project. Your feedback and insights are greatly appreciated as I continue to refine and expand my skills in the dynamic field of data science. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ“Š
